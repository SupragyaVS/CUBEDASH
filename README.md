CUBEDASH<br />
Please remember the project name is subject to change at anytime.<br />
CUBEDASH is an exciting game designed on Unity Engine using collision physics and C# movement  scripts, exclusively for Windows.<br />
The game is sleek and has a minimalist design and involves only one control - the arrow keys.<br />
CUBEDASH promises to provide a refreshing indie gaming experience for all Windows users.<br />
Cubedash can be imported to multiple platforms, currently its only available on windows at an installable file.<br />
The interface is very simple as it is a beginner level project and my first attempt at Game Development.<br />
I've provided the resource files here on Github so anyone can look at them and use them to make their own version of Cubedash or something better.<br /> 
I used Unity game engine as the development platform and VS studio to write the code.<br /> 
Do enjoy the game and have a good time!<br />
