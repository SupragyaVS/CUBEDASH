#First Game Development Project
Cubedash is a small playable game built in C# which can be imported to multiple platforms, currently its only available on windows at an installable file.
The interface is very simple as it is a beginner level project and my first attempt at Game Development, the ENTIRE game was built with help from the Brackeys 
Youtube channel, including the coding part. I hugely appreciate their help with this project. 
I've provided the resource files here on Github so anyone can look at them and use them to make their own version of Cubedash or something better. 
I used Unity game engine as the development platform and VS studio to write the code. 
Please enjoy the game.
